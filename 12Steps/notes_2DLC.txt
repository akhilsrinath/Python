3D plotting notes :
To plot 3D graphs we have used the Axes3D library

    from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

    fig = plt.figure(figsize = (11,7), dpi = 100)
    ax = fig.gca(projection = '3d')
    surf = ax.plot(X,Y, u[:])

The first line creates a figure window. figsize and dpi are optional and simply specify the size and resolution.

The X and Y values that you pass to plot_surface are not the 1-D vectors x and y.
In order to use matplotlibs 3D plotting functions, you need to generate a grid of x, y values which correspond to each coordinate
in the plotting frame.
This coordinate grid is generated using the numpy function meshgrid.

    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
